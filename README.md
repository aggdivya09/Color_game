# Color_game
🧠 Overview

This is a terminal-based Python game that challenges your focus and quick thinking!
Players must enter the color displayed, not the text written — a quick exercise in focus and reflexes.

The game:
1.Rewards correct answers with points and extra time
2.Reduces time for wrong answers
3.Features random color mixing and a scoreboard saved using file handling

⚙️ Tech & Logic Used:

1.random.shuffle() → to shuffle colors dynamically
2.input() → for player input
3.Lists & variables → to store color data and game state
4.Loops & conditionals → to control rounds and scoring
5.File handling → to save and read multiple player scores
6.time.sleep() → to control game pacing
7.ANSI escape codes → to bring colors to the terminal

💡 Key Learnings:

1.Designing an interactive command-line game from scratch
2.Implementing real-time gameplay with timers
3.Managing files for persistent player data
4.Using color codes to enhance user experience
5.Improving code readability and structure
